- `node-http-quark`, creates a HTTP app using the framework [quarkhttp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quarkhttp),
- `node-http-quark-get`, adds a GET route to your [quarkhttp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quarkhttp) app
- `node-http-quark-post`, adds a POST route to your [quarkhttp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quarkhttp) app

   ```javascript
   //  app.js
   const express = require('express')
   const app = express();
   // your route definitions
   module.exports = app;
   ```

   and that your file structure looks like this:

   ```bash
   -| app.js    // this is where the web app goes
   -| __tests__/
   ---| app.js  // this where the tests goes
   ```

- `node-supertest-beforeall`, configures supertest to use the app instance, this is a needed step to initialize supertest
